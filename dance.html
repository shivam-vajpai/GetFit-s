                <h3>Everything You Need to Know About Dance</h3>
                <p>Dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a given space, for the
                    purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement
                    itself.</p>
                <p>Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers
                    into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to
                    dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a
                    skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important
                    connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between
                    the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other.</p>
                <p>Although the above broad definition covers all forms of the art, philosophers and critics throughout
                    history have suggested different definitions of dance that have amounted to little more than
                    descriptions of the kind of dance with which each writer was most familiar. Thus, Aristotle’s
                    statement in the Poetics that dance is rhythmic movement whose purpose is “to represent men’s
                    characters as well as what they do and suffer” refers to the central role that dance played in
                    classical Greek theatre, where the chorus through its movements reenacted the themes of the drama
                    during lyric interludes</p>
                <p>A truly universal definition of dance must, therefore, return to the fundamental principle that dance
                    is an art form or activity that utilizes the body and the range of movement of which the body is
                    capable. Unlike the movements performed in everyday living, dance movements are not directly related
                    to work, travel, or survival. Dance may, of course, be made up of movements associated with these
                    activities, as in the work dances common to many cultures, and it may even accompany such
                    activities. But even in the most practical dances, movements that make up the dance are not
                    reducible to those of straightforward labour; rather, they involve some extra qualities such as
                    self-expression, aesthetic pleasure, and entertainment.</p>
                <h3>Benefits of Dance</h3>
                <h4><br>1. Improves cardiovascular health</h4>
                <p>The heart-pumping health benefits of dance are right in line with the Department of Health and Human
                    Services physical activity guidelinesTrusted Source for adults.</p>

                <h4><br>2. Improves balance and strength</h4>
                <p>Professional dancer Jonathan Tylicki, the director of education for AKT, a boutique fitness concept
                    rooted in dance, says one of the reasons dance is such a great form of physical fitness is because
                    it incorporates movements on all planes of motion and from all directions.</p>
                <h4><br>3. Gentle on your body</h4>
                <p>Many forms of dancing, such as ballroom, are appropriate for people with limited mobility or chronic
                    health issues.

                    If you have concerns about the intensity of a class, talk with your doctor and the instructor before
                    starting the class. They can help you with any modifications, if needed.</p>
                <h4><br>4. Boosts cognitive performance</h4>
                <p>If you need a reason to get moving, consider this: A lot of research shows how dancing can maintain
                    and even boost your ability to think as you age.

                    But how does this happen? Well, according to some studiesTrusted Source, scientists have found that
                    the areas of the brain that control memory and skills, such as planning and organizing, improve with
                    exercise like dance.

                    Plus, unlike other forms of exercise, dance has the additional benefits of improving balance through
                    rhythm and music.
