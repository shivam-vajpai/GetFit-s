                <h1>Cardio</h1>
                <h3>Everything You Need to Know About Cardio</h3>
                <p>Cardiovascular exercise is exercise that gets your heart rate up. Though some people use it solely
                    for weight loss, cardio has other benefits as well. There are a wide variety of cardiovascular
                    exercises, but consistency, duration, and intensity are the most important factors for meeting your
                    fitness goals. Read on to learn more about what this type of exercise is, the benefits it offers,
                    and how to create a safe and effective cardiovascular routine.</p>

                <h3><br>What Is Cardio?</h3>
                <p>Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity that
                    raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone. This is the zone where you burn the most
                    fat and calories.</p>
                <p>Part of what sets cardio apart from other types of exercise—such as strength training—is that it
                    relies on your body's ability to use oxygen during the workout session. A person's cardio ability or
                    capacity can vary based on a number of factors.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that your genes, sex, or age will prevent you from improving your cardiovascular
                    health. But it does help to know that there are many factors that can influence how (and how well)
                    your body responds to cardio exercise.</p>
                <h3><br>Benefits of Cardio</h3>
                <p>There are very few activities you can do for a short period of time that have all of the physical and
                    mental health benefits that cardio exercise offers. Some of the known benefits of cardio include:
                    <br><br>1. Burns fat and calories, making it easier to lose weight
                    <br>2.Enhances sleep quality, especially if the exercise is moderate to vigorous in intensity
                    <br>3. Expands lung capacity, or the amount of air that your lungs can hold
                    <br>4. Improves your sex life by increasing your body's ability to become aroused, improving your
                    body
                    image, and even potentially helping to treat medication-related sexual dysfunction
                    <br>5. Increases bone density when you do weight-bearing cardio exercises like hiking or climbing
                    stairs
                    <br>6. Lowers stress, in part by improving your ability to cope with issues in a positive way
                    <br>7. Promotes feeling good, and can even help relieve depression5 and anxiety
                    <br>8. Improves confidence in how you look and feel
                    <br>9. Reduces risk of heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some forms
                    of cancer
                    <br>10. Sets a good example for those around you, encouraging them to exercise with you
                    <br>11. Strengthens the heart so that it doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood
                </p>
                <h3>How to Choose Cardio Exercise</h3>
                <p>Your first step in choosing the right cardio workout for you is to figure out what kind of activities
                    you enjoy. Think about what fits your personality and what you'd feel comfortable fitting into your
                    life. This is key because if you don't like the exercise, you're less likely to stick with it
                    long-term.

                </p>
                <p>If you like to go outdoors, running, cycling, and walking are all good choices. If you prefer going
                    to the gym, you have access to many options in the form of stationary bikes, elliptical trainers,
                    treadmills, rowing machines, climbers, the pool, and more.</p>
                <h3>Cardio for Weight Loss</h3>
                <p>While the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggest that most people get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, the amount of exercise needed to lose weight is often greater. If you want to lose more than 5% of your body weight, you may need 300 minutes per week or more.</p>
                <p>These guidelines state that moderate-intensity activity is any activity that gets your heart rate going. However, they also indicate that incorporating high-intensity interval training often provides better results for people who are overweight or obese.</p>
                <p>Adding resistance training to your weekly cardio can also help. It works by increasing your lean muscle mass. Muscle creates a higher energy demand on your body, meaning more calories burned both at rest and while exercising.</p>
                <p>Combine your cardio with a healthy diet and you can boost your weight loss more. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating fruits, veggies, grains, low-fat dairy, lean proteins, and healthy oils while limiting added sugar, saturated fat, sodium, and alcohol</p>
